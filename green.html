            <p id="introdution">Welcome to my home on the Web. It's a rather sprawling demesne with many areas to explore and untold treasures to find. I am <br> always adding on, so chances are there will be new things to discover whenever you pass this way again. Feel free to poke around. I'll <br> be out back working on the Camel if you need anything.</p>

<p>You are standing before a large Victorian house at the southernmost end of what some call the Wild Coast. The early morning sun <br>filters through the branches of the stately live oaks shading the path to the broad apron surrounding the front. To the east you can hear <br>the faint sound of rolling surf mingled with the laughter of gulls. A narrow dirt path leads away to the west, across peaceful meadows,<br> and on up into some low, wooded hills. A sandy trail leads east through the woods to the shore not far away. And a winding ribbon of grass leads into the woods to the south. A baroque iron gaslamp stands at the meeting of the ways.
<br><br>
The front door appears to be unlocked. Do you wish to enter?</p>
